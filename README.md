# No Comment 
## A Chrome Extension
Do you have trouble stopping yourself from commenting on forums, social media, or elsewhere on the Web, when you should be working?  No Comment is here to help.

No Comment is an extension for Google's Chrome web browser, which lets you choose between preventing commenting entirely, or simply warning yourself whenever you try to comment.  Of course, you still want to be able to comment when you're not working, so No Comment let's you specify exactly what time and days of the week you want it to operate; the rest of the time it allows you to comment normally.

No Comment is completely free.  If you find any bugs or wish to suggest any features, please submit them using the "issues" tab above.
