# No Comment 
## A Chrome Extension
Do you have find you have difficulty stopping yourself from commenting on forums, social media, or elsewhere on the Web?  Does it impact your productivity? If so, No Comment is here to help.

No Comment is an extension for Google Chrome which lets you either between:

<ol type="A">
  <li>blocking yourself from commenting entirely, or </li>
  <li>reminding yourself every time you try to comment</li>
</ol>

Of course, you still want to be able to comment when you're not working, so No Comment let's you specify exactly what time and days of the week you want it to operate; the rest of the time it allows you to comment normally.

No Comment is completely free.  If you find any bugs or wish to suggest any features, please submit them using the "issues" tab above.
